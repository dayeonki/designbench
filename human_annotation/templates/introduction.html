    <h1>Graphic Design Annotation Task</h1>
    <p>Thank you for participating in this study aimed at validating <b>20 user queries and user-provided images</b> for a graphic design generation task.</p>

    <p>The goal of the <u>graphic design generation task</u> is to create graphic designs (e.g., a postcard) based on information from the user query.</p>
    
    <p>The <b>user query</b> reflects the user's request for creating one graphic design, including design choices such as background color, text, and images, where applicable. 
        The <b>user-provided images</b> are those the user intends to incorporate into their design.</p>

    <p>You will be asked to perform the following task:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Answer if the user query and the design choices are well-aligned at a 5-point Likert scale.</li>        
        <li>Rank the three images provided based on how well they fit the user query. Assign a rank from 1 (best fit) to 3 (least fit).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You will be provided GPT's assessment and its confidence level to aid your decision making.</p>

    <p>This annotation is expected to take 30-40 minutes in total.</p>
